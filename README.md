# Project Express API

Learning the basics of backend,  Build my own RESTful API by using Node js and Express.
Then to create several routes and endpoints that returns, different results, both collections and single ones.

I chose a new dataset. I used Kaggle to get the dataset, TED Talks, by downloading a CSV file and then using a service to convert from CSV to JSON.
I have used Postman and localhost:8080 to view the dataset.

## The problem
I mostly used the knowledge I got from codealong with both Damien and Daniel to make all this API works. 
And after choosing my on dataset, figure out what I whanted ti show and create some different Routes and Querys.

If I had more time I would have figured out how to find the mostviewd TED Talk and show which one not only how many views.
